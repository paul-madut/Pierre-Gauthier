Next.js Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. By moving component rendering to the server by default, we can significantly reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, resulting in faster page loads and improved performance.

## Understanding Server vs Client Components

In Next.js 13 and beyond, components are Server Components by default. This means they render on the server and send HTML to the client, dramatically reducing the JavaScript bundle size. Client Components, marked with the 'use client' directive, are used when you need interactivity, browser APIs, or state management.

The key is to use Server Components for most of your application and only reach for Client Components when necessary. This approach ensures you're sending the minimum amount of JavaScript to users while maintaining full interactivity where needed.

## Data Fetching Patterns

Server Components enable powerful data fetching patterns. You can fetch data directly in your components using async/await, without worrying about waterfalls or complex state management. The data is fetched on the server and streamed to the client as HTML, providing instant content to your users.

This approach also improves security, as you can access databases and APIs directly from Server Components without exposing sensitive credentials to the client. Your data fetching logic stays secure on the server, while users still get a fast, interactive experience.

## Composition Strategies

The real power of Server Components emerges when you compose them effectively. You can nest Server and Client Components, passing Server Components as children to Client Components. This allows you to maintain server-rendered content even within interactive components, optimizing both performance and developer experience.

Consider your component tree carefully. Place the 'use client' boundary as low as possible in your tree, ensuring only the components that truly need client-side interactivity are marked as Client Components. This strategy maximizes the benefits of Server Components while maintaining full application functionality.
