TypeScript has become the de facto standard for building large-scale JavaScript applications, but mastering its advanced features can be challenging. Here are essential tips that will elevate your TypeScript skills and help you build more robust applications.

## Discriminated Unions for Type Safety

Discriminated unions, also known as tagged unions, are one of TypeScript's most powerful features for handling different types of data. By using a common property (usually called 'type' or 'kind') to discriminate between union members, TypeScript can narrow types automatically in your code.

This pattern is particularly useful for handling different states in your application, such as loading, success, and error states. Instead of using boolean flags or optional properties, discriminated unions provide type-safe guarantees that eliminate entire classes of runtime errors.

## Leveraging Template Literal Types

Template literal types allow you to create new string literal types by combining existing ones. This feature is incredibly powerful for creating type-safe APIs, especially when dealing with dynamic property names or route parameters.

For example, you can create types that ensure URL paths are correctly formatted, or that CSS class names follow a specific pattern. Combined with mapped types, template literal types enable you to build incredibly flexible yet type-safe abstractions that catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

## Conditional Types and Inference

Conditional types enable you to create types that depend on other types, allowing for sophisticated type transformations. When combined with the 'infer' keyword, they become even more powerful, enabling you to extract and manipulate types in ways that weren't possible before.

These advanced type-level features allow you to build libraries and utilities that provide excellent TypeScript experience for consumers. While they can be complex, mastering conditional types opens up new possibilities for creating type-safe, flexible APIs.

## Using 'as const' for Literal Types

The 'as const' assertion is a simple but powerful feature that tells TypeScript to infer the most specific type possible. Instead of widening types to their general forms, 'as const' preserves literal types, readonly properties, and readonly arrays.

This is particularly useful when defining configuration objects, lookup tables, or any data structure where you want TypeScript to preserve exact values. It enables better autocomplete, stricter type checking, and can eliminate the need for manual type annotations in many cases.
