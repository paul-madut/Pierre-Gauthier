Building a React application that starts small is easy, but scaling it to handle complex business logic and large teams requires thoughtful architecture. Here are proven patterns that will help your React applications grow sustainably.

## Feature-Based Folder Structure

One of the most important decisions in a scalable React application is how you organize your code. A feature-based folder structure, where all code related to a feature lives together, dramatically improves maintainability as your application grows.

Instead of organizing by technical role (components, hooks, utilities), organize by domain feature. Each feature folder contains its own components, hooks, utilities, and tests. This makes it easy to understand, modify, and even extract features into separate packages if needed.

## Composition Over Configuration

React's component model shines when you embrace composition. Instead of creating highly configurable components with dozens of props, build small, focused components that can be composed together to create complex UIs.

This approach makes components easier to understand, test, and reuse. It also reduces the cognitive load when working with components, as each piece has a clear, single responsibility. Use component composition patterns like render props, compound components, and slot patterns to create flexible, reusable building blocks.

## State Management Strategies

Not all state is created equal. Distinguish between server state, global UI state, and local component state, and use appropriate tools for each. Server state should be managed with tools like React Query or SWR, which handle caching, revalidation, and synchronization automatically.

For global UI state, consider whether you actually need a state management library at all. React's Context API combined with hooks can handle many use cases that previously required Redux. When you do need more sophisticated state management, choose tools that align with your application's needs and your team's expertise.

## Performance Optimization Patterns

Performance in large React applications comes from preventing unnecessary renders and optimizing expensive operations. Use React.memo judiciously for components that receive the same props frequently. Leverage useMemo and useCallback to stabilize references and prevent cascading re-renders.

However, don't optimize prematurely. Measure first using React DevTools Profiler to identify actual bottlenecks, then apply optimizations strategically. Often, the biggest performance gains come from architectural decisions like code splitting and lazy loading rather than micro-optimizations.
