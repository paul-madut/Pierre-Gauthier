    "questions": [
      {
        "q": "How long does attic insulation installation take?",
        "a": "Most residential installations are completed in 4-8 hours, depending on the size of your home. We work efficiently to minimize disruption to your daily routine."
      },
      {
        "q": "What R-value insulation do I need in Ottawa?",
        "a": "For Ottawa's climate, we recommend R-60 to R-70 for optimal energy efficiency. Our assessment will determine the exact R-value needed for your specific home and current insulation levels."
      },
      {
        "q": "Will insulation installation create a mess in my home?",
        "a": "No. We use protective coverings throughout your home and employ dust-controlled installation methods. Our team performs complete cleanup, leaving your home cleaner than we found it."
      },
      {
        "q": "What rebates are available for insulation upgrades?",
        "a": "Ontario residents can receive up to $5,000 in combined rebates from federal, provincial, and utility programs. We handle all paperwork and ensure you receive maximum available rebates."
      },
      {
        "q": "How much will I save on energy bills?",
        "a": "Most customers see up to 40% reduction in heating and cooling costs. The exact savings depend on your home's current insulation, size, and energy usage patterns."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do you offer warranties on your work?",
        "a": "Yes. Materials come with a limited lifetime warranty from the manufacturer, and I personally provide a warranty on the quality of my installation work."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can you insulate other areas besides the attic?",
        "a": "Absolutely. We also insulate basements, crawl spaces, walls, and rim joists. Our assessment will identify all areas where improved insulation can benefit your home."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is blown-in insulation better than batt insulation?",
        "a": "For attics, blown-in insulation is superior as it fills gaps and irregular spaces completely, providing better thermal performance and air sealing compared to traditional batts."
